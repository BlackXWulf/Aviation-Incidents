# Aviation-Incidents
### Author: Jeremiah Rubin
# Overview

The Aviation Incidents Analysis project aims to provide a comprehensive examination of recent aviation incidents to enhance safety and operational efficiency. This analysis will help the Safety Director at Global Airways understand the factors contributing to incidents and develop strategies to mitigate risks, ultimately improving overall flight safety and regulatory compliance.

### Improve Safety Measures
By identifying trends and root causes of incidents, the project aims to enhance safety protocols and preventive measures. Implementing recommendations will reduce the likelihood of incidents, contributing to safer flight operations.

### Optimize Operational Efficiency
Understanding incident patterns can help streamline operational procedures and resource allocation. Reducing the frequency of incidents will lead to fewer disruptions and lower associated costs.

### Enhance Compliance and Risk Management
Insights from the analysis will support compliance with safety regulations and industry standards. Proactive risk management strategies will be developed to address identified issues and prevent future incidents.

### Strengthen Confidence in Safety Director at Global Airways
Providing a detailed analysis and actionable recommendations demonstrates a commitment to safety and continuous improvement. Transparent communication of findings and improvements will build trust with regulatory bodies, customers, and other stakeholders.

# Data Understanding
The dataset includes airplane models, engine counts, and makes from aviation accidents.
## Data Preparations
This analysis focuses on cleaning the data to show which airplane types are involved in incidents and how these incidents vary by aircraft type, allowing for a clearer understanding of the safety records and incident frequencies associated with different aircraft models.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
- *Descriptive Statistics*: Summarizing the main characteristics of the dataset.
- *Visualizations*: Bar graphs and other charts to visualize trends and patterns.
Modeling: Analyzing the relationship between engine count and incident frequency.

# Conclusion
- This analysis leads with the model of plane with the least amount incidents with the ideal amount of number of engines:

- Number of Engines. On average each plane with the least amount of incidents had only one engine.

- Model of plane. DC-9 model plane has the most engines with the least amount of incidents

- Injury Severity. all injury incidents were non-fatal for the planes that fit the companies risk free decision.
## Limitations
- The data set lacks the know how. In the data set doesn't show you how a plane had an incident, knowing that would help narrow down malfunctions or weather.

- Cost of each plane. The lack of cost for each individual plane and how much it would cost to repair them/salvage them.
## Recommendations
- The planes with the least amount of incidents. The company should go with the plane with non-fatal injuries for safety precautions.
- Saving money based on how many engines there is. The plane that has less engines and low incident reports will cost less in the future.
- Every year evaluation. Every year the company can expand their aviation side to gather more planes for business projects/improvements.
## Next Steps
Further analyses could yield additional insights to further improve choice of model plane:

- Better predictions for model plane based off repairing cost. This modeling could already use avaialable data such as how bad the crash was.

- Predicting undesirable outcomes. Knowing that the weather is really bad should delay the flight until further notice
