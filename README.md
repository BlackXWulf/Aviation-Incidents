The head of the aviation division may be able to chose an airplane model that is low in potential risk of failure through the least amount of incidents and how many engines a plane has. Doing so the company can continue to grow in the aviation division. Using aviation data set, I will be showing the model of airplanes with the least amount of incidents and the amount of engines they have.
