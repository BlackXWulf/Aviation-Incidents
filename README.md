# Aviation-Incidents
### Author: Jeremiah Rubin
# Overview

The Aviation Incidents Analysis project aims to provide a comprehensive examination of recent aviation incidents to enhance safety and operational efficiency. This analysis will help the Safety Director at Global Airways understand the factors contributing to incidents and develop strategies to mitigate risks, ultimately improving overall flight safety and regulatory compliance.

### Improve Safety Measures
By identifying trends and root causes of incidents, the project aims to enhance safety protocols and preventive measures. Implementing recommendations will reduce the likelihood of incidents, contributing to safer flight operations.

### Optimize Operational Efficiency
Understanding incident patterns can help streamline operational procedures and resource allocation. Reducing the frequency of incidents will lead to fewer disruptions and lower associated costs.

### Enhance Compliance and Risk Management
Insights from the analysis will support compliance with safety regulations and industry standards. Proactive risk management strategies will be developed to address identified issues and prevent future incidents.

### Strengthen Confidence in Safety Director at Global Airways
Providing a detailed analysis and actionable recommendations demonstrates a commitment to safety and continuous improvement. Transparent communication of findings and improvements will build trust with regulatory bodies, customers, and other stakeholders.

# Data Understanding
The dataset includes airplane models, engine counts, and makes from aviation accidents.
## Data Preparations
This analysis focuses on cleaning the data to show which airplane types are involved in incidents and how these incidents vary by aircraft type, allowing for a clearer understanding of the safety records and incident frequencies associated with different aircraft models.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Data Visualization
The analysis includes several visualizations to explore the relationship between aircraft makes, engine types, and incident occurrences:

- **Distribution of Aircraft Makes:** A pie chart showing the percentage of incidents by make.
- **Counts of Aviation Incidents by Make and Number of Engines:** A bar plot illustrating the relationship between aircraft makes and their engine counts.
- **Aircraft Types by Make and Engine Type:** A bar graph comparing counts of incidents across different engine types.

# Conclusion
The analysis of aviation incidents provides valuable insights into the trends and patterns within the dataset. Visualizations highlight how different aircraft categories and engine types correlate with incident frequency, enabling stakeholders to identify potential risk factors.

## Limitations
- **Data Completeness:** The analysis relies on the accuracy and completeness of the dataset.
- **External Factors:** The analysis does not account for external factors such as weather conditions or pilot experience.
- **Generalization:** Findings may not be universally applicable across all regions or types of aviation operations.
## Recommendations
- **Targeted Safety Initiatives:** Develop initiatives focusing on aircraft categories and engine types with higher incident rates, including enhanced training for pilots and maintenance personnel.
- **Ongoing Monitoring:** Establish a continuous monitoring system to regularly analyze aviation incident data.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Encourage aviation authorities to incorporate data analytics into their decision-making processes for safety improvements.
## Next Steps
- **Further Research:** Conduct research to incorporate external factors influencing incident rates.
- **Expand Analysis:** Broaden the analysis to include more variables such as geographical regions and operational contexts.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Engage with industry stakeholders to disseminate findings and collaborate on safety initiatives.
